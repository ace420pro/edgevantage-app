# EdgeVantage Deployment Checklist for Vercel

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Code Changes Committed and Pushed
- ‚úÖ Updated earning rates from $500-$1000 to $250-$500 throughout the application
- ‚úÖ Fixed irregular number display with `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`
- ‚úÖ All changes committed with descriptive message
- ‚úÖ Changes pushed to GitHub (commit: 0517740)
- ‚úÖ Vercel will automatically deploy from this push

### 2. Production URL Configuration
The application is properly configured for production deployment:
- Frontend uses relative API paths (`API_URL = ''`) which work correctly on Vercel
- API functions in `/api` folder are serverless functions that deploy automatically
- CORS is configured to allow `https://edgevantagepro.com` and `https://www.edgevantagepro.com`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Environment Variables Required in Vercel

You need to set these environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

### Required Variables:
```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
NODE_ENV=production
FRONTEND_URL=https://edgevantagepro.com
```

### Optional Variables (if using these services):
```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_token
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_jwt_refresh_secret
```

## üìù Localhost References Found

The codebase has some localhost references, but they are properly handled:

### ‚úÖ Properly Configured (No Action Needed):
1. **API middleware** (`/api/lib/middleware.js`): Correctly allows localhost only in development
2. **Frontend API calls**: Use relative paths (`API_URL = ''`) which work in production
3. **Backend CORS**: Configured to allow production domain

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend Server (Not Used in Vercel Deployment):
The `/backend` folder contains an Express server with localhost references, but this is NOT used in Vercel deployment. Vercel uses the serverless functions in `/api` folder instead.

## üöÄ Deployment Process

1. **Automatic Deployment**: Your push to GitHub has triggered an automatic Vercel deployment
2. **Monitor Deployment**: Check your Vercel dashboard for deployment status
3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are set in Vercel project settings
4. **Domain Configuration**: Verify that `edgevantagepro.com` is properly configured in Vercel

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify:
1. The application loads at https://edgevantagepro.com
2. Form submissions work correctly
3. API endpoints respond properly
4. Analytics tracking is functional
5. All earning rates display as $250-$500
6. Numbers display with consistent formatting (tabular)

## üìå Important Notes

- The `/backend` folder is a standalone Express server (not used in Vercel deployment)
- Vercel uses serverless functions from the `/api` folder
- All API routes are relative, so they work correctly in production
- MongoDB connection string must be set in Vercel environment variables
- The application has no authentication system (all endpoints are public)

## üîê Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files to git
2. **MongoDB**: Ensure your MongoDB connection uses authentication
3. **CORS**: Production CORS settings are properly restrictive
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implemented in API middleware
5. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
